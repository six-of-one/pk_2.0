2.1 release mix with the archon code base.

===========================================================================

What is Painkeep?

"PainKeep is a DeathMatch-only "mission-pack" designed for use with registered
Quake. PainKeep not only offers brand new weapons (with new pickup and view
models), but also a new rich environment with tons of new sounds, new special
effects, great new features, and lots of surprises. Every modification
included is original. This is in no way a compilation of various "weekend
mods" from the net."

Goals:

PainKeep goes back to Deathmatch's original emphasis. Make other players die.
